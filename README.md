# About Me

Hello, world! I'm Patrik BajzÃ­k, a 19-year-old computer science student at Brno University of Technology. I'm fueled by my passion for understanding the nuances of computer science, and my commitment to learning is as strong as my love for coffee and sweets. 

Speaking of sweets, I've got a sweet tooth that could rival Willy Wonka's, but life threw me a curveball and made me diabetic. Now, I'm not in any 'Diabetes Club', but I've learned to appreciate the artificial sweeteners in life. So, if you see me sipping on a sugar-free energy drink or munching on a sugar-free candy, remember, I'm not just feeding my cravings, I'm also keeping my blood sugar in check. 

I hail from the beautiful country of Slovakia. Despite its political ups and downs, my pride in being Slovak remains unwavering. After all, home is where the heart is, right? ðŸ˜„
